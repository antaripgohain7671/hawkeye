# Hawk Eye Security and Monitoring System

NOTE: This repo contains crappy code created in a hurry. I copy pasted many things from stackoverflow without even knowing what they do. So use this repo as a reference if you are building something similar, but nothing more than that.

This is the code for the final semester project by IoT Group 6, Jain University, Dept of BCA, 2021.

## Using the code

Run the following on the root folder to start the node server:

<code> npm start </code>

Change directory into the frontend folder and run the same command to start the react app.
